    # Set the value of a variable or a convenience variable.

    # within fdb; they are not part of your program.
    # Convenience variables are prefixed with '$' and can
    # be any name that does not conflict with any existing
    # variable.  For example, $myVar.  Convenience variables
    # are also used to control various aspects of fdb.
    #
    # The following convenience variables are used by fdb.
    # $listsize          - number of source lines to display for 'list'
    # $columnwrap        - column number on which output will wrap
    # $infostackshowthis - if 0, does not display 'this' in stack backtrace
    # $invokegetters     - if 0, prevents fdb from firing getter functions
    # $bpnum             - the last defined breakpoint number
    # $displayattributes - if 1, 'print var.' displays all attributes of members
    #                      of 'var' (e.g. private, static)
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    #   set i = 3
    #
    # Sets the variable 'i' to the number 3.
    #
    #   set employee.name = "Susan"
    #
    # Sets the variable 'employee.name' to the string "Susan".
    #
    #   set $myVar = 20
    #
    # Sets the convenience variable '$myVar' to the number 20
