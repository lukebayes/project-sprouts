    <h1>What Is It?</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>Project Sprouts is a highly cohesive, loosely coupled collection of features that take <em>some</em> of the suck out of programming.</p>

    <p>Sprouts is a modular development platform that takes advantage of <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://rubygems.org">RubyGems</a> to share code generators, libraries, executables and automated build tasks. It runs anywhere Ruby does, including OS X, Windows, and *nix variants.</p>

    <p>Sprouts has been seen working on Mac, Windows and Linux and while it currently targets ActionScript, Flex and AIR development, tools can be easily created to improve any programming environment.</p>

    <h2 id="testimonials">What are are folks saying?</h2>
    <div id="quotes">
      <blockquote>The best thing to happen to Flex since Matt Chotin....</blockquote>
      <div class="attribution">Ryan Stewart, Adobe Flash Platform Evangelist</div>

      <blockquote>I swear project sprouts is the most significant single thing in terms of changing my work flow.</blockquote>

    <h2 id="reasons">Why would someone use Sprouts?</h2>
    <p>There are lots of reasons to use Sprouts for your projects, here are some of mine:</p>
    <ul class="reasons">
      <li><strong>Decouple builds</strong> from development tools</li>
      <li><strong>Consistent environment</strong> across any size team</li>
      <li><strong>Platform independent</strong> critical tools</li>
      <li><strong>Automatically generate</strong> project files, directories, classes, test cases, and test suites</li>
      <li><strong>Continuous Integration</strong> simplified</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
    To get started with Project Sprouts and Flash development, you'll need Ruby (>= 1.9.2 <a href="#">Mac</a>, <a href="#">Win</a>, <a href="#">Nix</a>), <a href="#">RubyGems</a> (>= 1.3.7) and at least some interest in the programming language <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> and the build tool <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/rake.html">Rake</a>.
    </p>

{% highlight bash %}
# Install the ActionScript 3 / Flash Bundle:
gem install flashsdk --pre

# Generate a new ActionScript 3 project:
sprout-as3 SomeProject

# Move into the new project:
cd SomeProject

# Install dependencies:
bundle install

# Compile and run the main project:
rake

# Congratulations - you're up and running!
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
    Go a little further with Test-Driven Development:
    </p>

{% highlight bash %}
# Generate a class, test and test suite:
sprout-class utils.MathUtil

# Compile and run the test harness:
rake test
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
    And finally:
    </p>

{% highlight bash %}
# Show available tasks:
rake -T
{% endhighlight %}

    <h1>Getting Help</h1>

    <p>Sometimes, getting everything set up and running doesn't go as smoothly as we hope. When this happens, we consider this a failure on our end. One of the core objectives behind Sprouts is to make it painless to get up and running&mdash;if it's not, then we have failed.</p>
    
    <p>If the information on the <a href="/installation.html">installation</a> page doesn't get you unstuck, please <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/projectsprouts">send us</a> your operating system information, any potentially helpful terminal output and the following:</p>
