h1. Project Sprouts

Project Sprouts is an open-source, cross-platform project generation and configuration tool for ActionScript 2, ActionScript 3, and Flex projects.

Project Sprouts provides everything you need to get up and running with SWF development instantly. The only prerequisites are Ruby and RubyGems.

Sprouts includes support for project and code templates, automated build scripts, remote managed libraries, and automatic installation of dependencies like the Flash VM and a variety of compilers and tools.

Sprouts works on OS X, Windows XP, Windows Vista and many flavors of Linux.

h3. Installation

# "Install Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
# "Install RubyGems":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=126
# Install the Sprout gem:

<code><pre>gem install sprout</pre></code>
_(If prompted, select the appropriate gem for your platform.)_

h3. Getting Started

Open a terminal and enter the following commands:

Create a new ActionScript 3 project and move into it:

<pre><code>sprout -n as3 SomeProject
cd SomeProject</code></pre>

Resolve all dependencies, compile and launch the SWF:

<pre><code>rake</code></pre>

Generate a new class, test case and test suite:

<pre><code>script/generate utils.MathUtil</code></pre>

Compile and launch the test harness:

<pre><code>rake test</code></pre>

Compile a SWC file:

<pre><code>rake swc</code></pre>

Generate documentation using "AsDoc":http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/ASDoc:

<pre><code>rake doc</code></pre>

Execute the test harness, emit a JUnit-compatible test results document, and close the Flash Player when complete or after encountering an uncaught exception:

<pre><code>rake cruise</code></pre>

Display all available Rake tasks:

<pre><code>rake -T</code></pre>

h3. Some Simple, Sample Rake Tasks

Sprouts brings the power of the "Rake":http://martinfowler.com/articles/rake.html build language to SWF development. Rake is similar to Make and Ant, but harnesses the full power and flexibility of Ruby to help us describe the structure and automate the behavior of any build, from the simplest to the most complex.

Following are some simple examples of the Rake tasks that Sprouts provides:

_ActionScript 3 and MXML Projects:_
<pre><code>mxmlc :debug do |t|
	t.input = 'src/SomeProject.as'
	t.output = 'bin/SomeProject.swf'
end

compc :deploy do |t|
	t.input = 'src/SomeProject.as'
	t.output = 'bin/SomeProject.swc'
end

asdoc :doc do |t|
	t.doc_classes = 'SomeProject'
	t.source_path = 'src'
end

flashplayer :run do |t|
	t.swf = 'bin/SomeProject.swf'
end
</code></pre>

_ActionScript 2 Projects:_
<code><pre>mtasc :debug do |t|
	t.main = true
	t.header = '800:600:24'
	t.input = 'src/SomeProject.as'
	t.output = 'bin/SomeProject.swf'
end

swfmill :skin do |t|
	t.input = 'assets/skins/SomeProjectSkin'
	t.output = 'assets/skins/SomeProjectSkin.swf'
end

flashplayer :run do |t|
	t.swf = 'bin/SomeProject.swf'
end
</code></pre>
