  # This is a class that is generally used by the Sprout::Specification::add_file_target method.
  #
  # File targets are files that are embedded into (or referred to by) a RubyGem in such a way
  # that Sprouts can use them as a library or executable.
  #
  # A given FileTarget may be configured to work on a specific platform, or it may be
  # universal.
