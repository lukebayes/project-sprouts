  # The ProcessRunner is a cross-platform wrapper for executing
  # external executable processes.
  #
  # This class is typically accesses via the concrete Sprout::System
  # classes in order to avoid ugly branching logic in the application
  # layer.
  #
  # An example of this kind of usage might be:
  #
  #   Sprout.current_system.execute './some.exe', '--foo=bar --baz=buz'
  #
  # To use this class directly, you need to know if you're on
  # a unix-like system or a dos platform as these two deal with
  # processes very differently.
  #
  # Assuming you know you're on a unix-like system, you could
  # execute the previous example with:
  #
  #   runner = Sprout::ProcessRunner.new
  #   runner.execute_open4 './some.exe --foo-bar --baz=buz'
  #   puts runner.read
  #
  class ProcessRunner
