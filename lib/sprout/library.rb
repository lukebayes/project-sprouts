  ##
  # Sprout Libraries provide support for sharing and versioning raw or
  # pre-compiled source code across projects.
  #
  # Sprout Libraries give us the ability to include raw (or pre-compiled) source
  # code directly within a Ruby Gem, or to refer to an archive somewhere on
  # the internet.
  #
  # A Sprout Library is made up of two components:
  #
  # * Specification: The description of the library
  # * Source Code: Raw or pre-compiled (swc, jar, abc)
  #
  # = Specification
  #
  # Libraries can be added to local or remote file targets in a
  # Sprout::Specification. When calling add_library, one must provide the
  # library name (symbol that will be used from Rake) and a relative path (or
  # Array of paths) from the Specification to the library file or directory.
  #
  # Following is an example of a Sprout::Specification that registers a SWC
  # that will be distributed directly within a Ruby Gem:
  #
  #   Sprout::Specification.new do |s|
  #     s.name = "asunit4"
  #     s.version = "4.4.2"
  #     s.add_file_target do |f|
  #       f.add_library :swc, File.join('bin', "AsUnit-4.4.2.swc")
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Following is an example of a Sprout::Specification that registers a ZIP
  # archive that will be distributed separately from the Ruby Gem:
  #
  #   Sprout::Specification.new do |s|
  #     s.name = "asunit3"
  #     s.version = "3.0.0"
  #     s.add_remote_file_target do |f|
  #       f.url = "https://github.com/patternpark/asunit/tree/3.0.0"
  #       f.md5 = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
  #       f.add_library :swc, "bin/AsUnit-3.0.1.zip"
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Libraries can be consumed from any Rakefile without concern for how
  # the source code is distributed. Following is an example Rake task
  # that uses the AsUnit 4.0 Library:
  #
  #   # Define the library Rake::Task:
  #   library :asunit4
  #
  #   # Add the library as a dependency from another task
  #   # that should know how to properly associate the files:
  #   mxmlc 'bin/SomeProject.swf' => :asunit4 do |t|
  #     t.input = 'src/SomeProject.as'
  #   end
  #
  # When the library task is executed, the library should be resolved and
  # expanded into the project. When the mxmlc task is executed, the installed
  # library should be associated with the compilation command.
  #
  # Some library Specifications include multiple targets within the same Specification.
  #
  # One good example of such a Spec, is the FlashSDK :flex4 Specification.
  #
  # Following is a truncated version of that Spec:
  #
  #   Sprout::Specification.new do |s|
  #     s.name    = 'flex4'
  #     s.version = '4.1.0.16076'
  #     s.add_remote_file_target do |t|
  #       t.platform     = :universal
  #       t.archive_type = :zip
  #       t.url          = "http://fpdownload.adobe.com/pub/flex/sdk/builds/flex4/flex_sdk_4.1.0.16076.zip"
  #       t.md5          = "4c5f3d3fa4e1f5be244679210cd852c0"
  #       t.add_library :flex,         "frameworks/libs/flex.swc"
  #       t.add_library :flex4,        "frameworks/libs/flex4.swc"
  #       t.add_library :f_textlayout, "frameworks/libs/framework_textLayout.swc"
  #       t.add_library :framework,    "frameworks/libs/framework.swc"
  #       t.add_library :rpc,          "frameworks/libs/rpc.swc"
  #       t.add_library :sparkskins,   "frameworks/libs/sparkskins.swc"
  #       t.add_library :textlayout,   "frameworks/libs/textLayout.swc"
  #       t.add_library :utilities,    "frameworks/libs/utilities.swc"
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Because this library Specification is included in the flashsdk Rubygem, you
  # would register the spec by loading the flashsdk gem from your Gemfile like:
  #
  #   gem 'flashsdk', '>= 1.0.0.pre'
  #
  # Once the Rubygem is installed, you can load and register this library with
  # the following library task in your rakefile:
  #
  #   library :flex4
  #
  # Once the library is registered, you can refer to particular SWC files within the library like:
  #
  #   mxmlc "bin/Foo.swf" => [:utilities, :textlayout] do |t|
  #     ...
  #   end

# From within a Rakefile, you can load libraries
# by calling this method:
#
#   library :asunit4
#
# Or, if you would like to specify which registered
# library to pull from the identified package (by name):
#
#   library :asunit4, :src
#
# Or, if you'd like to specify version requirements:
#
#   library :asunit4, :swc, '>= 4.2.pre'
#
# It's important to note that libraries must also
# be defined in your Gemfile like:
#
#   gem "asunit4", ">= 4.2.pre"
#
# Libraries are generally then added to compiler tasks
# as Rake dependencies like:
#
#   mxmlc 'bin/SomeRunner.swf' => [:asunit4] do |t|
#     t.input = 'src/SomeRunner.as'
#     t.source_path << 'test'
