  ##
  # The Sprout::Daemon class exposes the Domain Specific Language
  # provided by the Sprout::Executable, along with
  # enhancements (and modifications) to support long-lived processes
  # (like FDB and FCSH).
  #
  #   ##
  #   # The Foo class extends Sprout::Daemon
  #   class Foo < Sprout::Daemon
  #
  #     ##
  #     # Keep in mind that we're still working
  #     # with Executable, so add_param is available
  #     # for the initialization of the process.
  #     add_param :input, File
  #
  #     ##
  #     # Expose the do_something action after
  #     # the process is started.

  #     # Expose the do_something_else action after
  #     # the process is started.

  #
  # You can also create a globally-accessible rake task to use
  # your new Daemon instance by creating a method like the following:
  #
  #   def foo *args, &block
  #     foo_tool = Foo.new
  #     foo_tool.to_rake *args, &block
  #   end
  #
  # The previous Rake task could be used like:
  #
  #   foo 'Bar.txt' do |t|
  #     t.do_something
  #     t.do_something_else
  #   end
